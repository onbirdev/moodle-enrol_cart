# Moodle Shopping Cart

This plugin adds a complete shopping cart system to Moodle by introducing a new "Cart" enrolment method.
Users can add courses to their cart and proceed to payment using any of the supported Moodle payment gateways

Users can access their shopping cart from the cart icon in the top navigation bar and view their purchase history via the "My Purchases" option in the user menu.
Courses can also be added to the cart before logging in â€” the cart data is stored in a cookie and automatically transferred to the database upon login, allowing users to proceed with payment seamlessly.

This plugin allows administrators to define a fixed discount amount or a percentage discount for each course.
Additionally, it supports the use of coupon codes during checkout by implementing the `enrol_cart\local\object\coupon_interface` interface and configuring the `coupon_class` in the cart enrollment settings.

An example implementation (`enrol_cart\local\object\coupon_example` class) is included in the plugin to demonstrate how to build your own coupon logic.
